FlashCoin
=============

Setup
---------------------
FlashCoin is the original FlashCoin client and it builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of FlashCoin transactions, which requires several hundred gigabytes or more of disk space. Depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to several days or more.

To download FlashCoin, visit [FlashCoincore.org](https://FlashCoincore.org/en/download/).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run FlashCoin on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/FlashCoin-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/FlashCoind` (headless)
- `bin/FlashCoin` (wrapper command)

The `FlashCoin` command supports subcommands like `FlashCoin gui`, `FlashCoin node`, and `FlashCoin rpc` exposing different functionality. Subcommands can be listed with `FlashCoin help`.

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run FlashCoin-qt.exe.

### macOS

Drag FlashCoin to your applications folder, and then run FlashCoin.
